    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Nihita Kasibhatla, and swimming has been a huge part of my life. I grew up in New Jersey, where I attended JP Stevens High School in Edison. From a young age, I developed a love for swimming, and throughout my high school years, I became heavily involved in both school and competitive swimming. I spent countless hours in the pool, working on my strokes and pushing myself to become better each day.

        While I enjoyed all aspects of swimming, my favorite stroke was always the breaststroke. There’s something about the rhythm and technique of it that felt natural to me. I loved swimming with my high school team and also spent time swimming outside of school, which allowed me to gain even more experience. The sport gave me not only physical strength but also taught me the importance of discipline, perseverance, and teamwork. Swimming isn’t just about the race for me; it's about pushing through challenges, setting goals, and continuously improving.
